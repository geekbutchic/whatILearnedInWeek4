# What I learned in Week-4

* ### While loops 
* ### For Loops
* ### Loops with Indices 
* ### Arrays 
* ### String Building 

## While Loops 
* The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
* While loops are often used in applications and have three parts.
* The set-up.
* Check or the condition.
* The change.
* This type of loop will run as long as the condition is true.

## For Loops 
* The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false.
* Similar to the while loop, although the syntax line is expressed in one single line.  

## Loops with indices 
* While looping what if we wanted to pull a certain character at a certain index.  Say for the users initials, this is where loops with Indices come into play.
* They allow us to pull a certain character at a certain index.

## Arrays 
* In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable.
* Within the array were learned certain commands.
* **.push** - appends new elements to the array.
* **.pop** - removes the last element from an array and returns it.
* **.shift** - removes teh first element from an array and returns it.
* **.unshift** -  inserts new elements at the start of an array.
* **.splice** - removes elements from an array, and if necessary, inserts new elements in their place.
* **.slice** - returns a section of an array.
* **.reverse** - reverse the elements in the array.

## String Building 

* The concat() method concatenates the string arguments to the calling string and returns a new string.
* Receiving one string and returning another with new arguments.
* This method does not change the existing strings, but returns a new string containing the text of the joined strings.
